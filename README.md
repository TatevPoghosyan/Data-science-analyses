## 📊 Key Findings and Academic Conclusions

### 1. Automation Risk and AI Exposure

The analysis reveals a **strong positive relationship between the AI Exposure Index and Automation Probability by 2030**. Job roles with higher exposure to AI technologies tend to exhibit significantly greater automation risk, suggesting that AI-driven task substitution will disproportionately affect certain occupations.

### 2. Salary Patterns and Automation

A noticeable inverse relationship is observed between **average salary levels and automation probability**. Higher-paying roles generally demonstrate lower susceptibility to automation, indicating that specialized knowledge, decision-making complexity, and strategic responsibilities may act as protective factors against AI-driven displacement.

### 3. Role of Experience

Jobs requiring **greater years of experience** tend to show lower automation risk and reduced AI exposure. This finding highlights the importance of accumulated domain knowledge and contextual expertise in maintaining job resilience in the presence of advancing AI technologies.

### 4. Skill Composition and Job Resilience

Skill-based analysis indicates that roles characterized by **higher and more diverse skill requirements** are less vulnerable to automation. This supports the hypothesis that multi-skill adaptability plays a crucial role in mitigating AI-related employment risks.

### 5. Correlation Structure

Correlation analysis demonstrates meaningful interdependencies among experience, salary, skills, and automation metrics. These relationships suggest that workforce vulnerability to AI is a **multifactorial phenomenon**, rather than being driven by a single determinant.

## 📝 Overall Conclusion

This exploratory analysis provides empirical evidence that AI’s impact on future employment will not be uniform across occupations. Instead, it will depend on a combination of factors including skill intensity, experience requirements, and economic value generation.

The findings emphasize the necessity of **upskilling, reskilling, and adaptive education policies** to prepare the workforce for AI-driven transformation. From a data science perspective, the dataset offers strong potential for further modeling, clustering, and predictive analysis.
